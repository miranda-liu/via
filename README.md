# VIA
A web application that pinpoints dangerous areas with real time police data, providing users with a safe, secure walking experience.

### Getting Started
- Run ``python front_end/create_json.py > front_end/output.js`` in your terminal
- Run ```open front_end/map.html``` in your terminal

### How It Works
When you open VIA, you will be directed to a map of Boston with major crimes pinpointed like below. <br />

You can zoom in and out using the two-finger pinch method to choose your starting point. The point will show up as a blue dot like below. <br />

Click a second time to set your end destination, and VIA will offer you 1-3 routes that are both quick and relatively safer.<br />

To receive new directions, just click twice more to reset your starting point and end point, and VIA will show you your new destination route(s).<br />
