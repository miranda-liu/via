# VIA
A web application that pinpoints dangerous areas with real time police data, providing users with a safe, secure walking experience.

### Getting Started
- Run ``python front_end/create_json.py > front_end/output.js`` in your terminal
- Run ```open front_end/map.html``` in your terminal

### How It Works
When you open VIA, you will be directed to a map of Boston with major crimes pinpointed like below.

You can zoom in and out using the two-finger pinch method to choose your starting point. The point will show up as a blue dot like below.

Click a second time to set your end destination, and VIA will offer you 1-3 routes that are both quick and relatively safer.
